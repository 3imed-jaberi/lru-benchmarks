# LRUs benchmarks ðŸ“Š.
---

### Benchmark the LRUs (least-recently-used) caches which are available on npm which inspired from [fastify-benchmarks][] and [bench-lru][].

I run a very simple multi-process benchmark, with 20 iterations to get a median of ops/ms:

  1. Set the LRU to fit max N=800,000 items.
  2. Add N random numbers to the cache, with keys 0-N.
  3. Then update those keys with new random numbers.
  4. Then evict those keys, by adding keys N-2N.

You can see the result on [benchmarks-results.json](./benchmarks-results.json).


#### Opinion

Based to the results and experiences I can say the better choice in heavy operations is `mnemonist/lru-cache` otherwise `hashlru` is the most stable.
